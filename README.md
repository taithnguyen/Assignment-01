## Journal App Analysis
By Tai Nguyen - DH 150

*This project is a heuristic analysis of journal/self care tracking apps through the lens of middle aged women. This will be done by assessing two mobile apps, Jour and Tangerine and comment on what has been done well and what aspects can be improved upon. My overall project that builds off this analysis will be the creation of a simple, easy to use journaling/tracking app that improves mental health and productivity for middle aged women. *

## Jour

[Jour](https://jour.com/) is an interactive journal focused on improving mindfulness, mental health, and sleep. This goal is achieved through daily check ins, questions, and other interactive journaling.

# Visibility of system status: 
*Does the user always have a good idea of their progress or next step?*
| Comments     | Severity Rating |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| After completing the daily journal, Jour does not emphasize where else to go or what other activities are available on the app.     | 3      |
| A fix would be showing users what recommended actions are next such as viewing X tab on the For You page.   | 3        |

# Match between system and real world: 
*Does the vocabulary and process follow real world vocabulary and natural progressions?*
| Comments     | Severity Rating |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Jour does a good job at using easy to understand wording as well as illustrations that make it clear what options to choose from.   | 1      |

# User control and freedom: 
*Does the app allow the user freedom to undo or move forward from any given action?*
| Comments     | Severity Rating |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Once users get to the journaling page, there is no way to escape without skipping or completing the process.    | 3      |
| Adding a back button or a dialogue to complete later would solve this.  | 3       |

# Consistency and standards: 
*Does the app have consistent vocabulary, functions, and processes from one page to the next?*
| Comments     | Severity Rating |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Jour remains consistent and simplistic with its vocabulary and functions from page to page. However a small suggestion would be to group functions better. For example, journaling should be on a separate page from exploring or instructionals.     | 2     |

# Error prevention: 
*Does the app have appropriate warnings and feedback to prevent unnecessary user errors?*
| Comments     | Severity Rating |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Jour's lack of direction and very broad prompts can lead users to being inefficient with their journaling.    | 3      |
| More detailed prompts or perhaps even a character requirement might get users more involved and understand the direction required   | 2        |

# Recognition rather than recall: 
*Does the app minimize the amount of memorizing the user has to do to proceed through the app?*
| Comments     | Severity Rating |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Jour's journaling design allows for no need for memorization at all and since there is no complex jargon, there is no memorization component to Jour.      | 1      |

# Flexibility and efficiency of use: 
*Does the app provide learnable but not necessary accelerators to allow experienced users to move more efficiently?*
| Comments     | Severity Rating |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Jour does not have any accelerators, but the app is straightforward and simple enough that no accelerators are necessary to be efficient.     | 1       |

# Aesthetic and minimalist design: 
*Are the imporant functions clearly highlighted and is unnecessary or distraction features removed?*
| Comments     | Severity Rating |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Extraneous information such as the number of people journaling is distracting and does not contribute at all to the goal of the app    | 2      |
| More focus should be put on other functions of the app such as the For You bar   | 2        |

# Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors: 
*Does the app allow for easy and clear diagnosing of any errors the user might encounter?*
| Comments     | Severity Rating |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Jour does not currently provide any error messages due to the freedom involved in the app outside of onboarding. There is not much room for error so this is not an issue     | 1      |

# Help and documentation: 
*Does the app provide useful information that may aid the user through any troubles or questions they might encounter?*
| Comments     | Severity Rating |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Jour does not provide any sort of real feedback on if what is journaled is actually useful or helpful at the moment. However, this is not a severe issue as freedom is a central aspect of journaling.  | 1      |
| Providing more of a guide or even examples of a good journal would eliminate this issue.  | 1      |

## Tangerine
